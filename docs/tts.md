# Photobooth UX & TTS

The photobooth uses the browser’s Web Speech API for free TTS to guide users and speak the countdown.

## Enabling TTS
- Settings → TTS → Enable TTS
- Choose a `voice` by its name (must be installed on the OS/browser)
- Customize the `prompt` (played before the countdown)

## Notes
- Voices vary by OS/browser; if a voice name isn’t found, default voice is used
- TTS runs on the client; no server costs
